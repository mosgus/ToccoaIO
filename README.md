# Toccoa.io — Proto 1.0

AI-powered commercial property and tenant research for credit analysts.

Given a property address and optional tenant name, the app uses a two-stage AI pipeline to produce a structured analyst report suitable for commercial lending decisions.

## Setup

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install streamlit anthropic google-genai
```

**Add API keys** (one key per file, no trailing newline required):
```
keys/gemini_key.txt   ← Google Gemini API key
keys/claude_key.txt   ← Anthropic Claude API key
```

**Verify connectivity:**
```bash
python APItest.py
```

**Run the app:**
```bash
streamlit run real_estate_intel/app.py
```

## How It Works

### Stage 1 — Gemini Web Research (`research_property`)

Model: `gemini-2.5-flash` with **Google Search grounding** enabled.

Gemini performs live web searches to gather current intelligence across four categories:

| Category | What It Looks For |
|---|---|
| **Building Permits & NOC** | Recent permit filings, notice of commencement, scope of work, permit status |
| **Tenant / Business News** | Closures, expansions, relocations, lease activity, financial stress signals |
| **Vacancy & Listing Status** | (if no tenant) Active for-sale/for-lease listings, listing broker, vacancy duration, prior tenants |
| **Public Records** | Tax liens, zoning changes, recent sales, ownership transfers, code violations |

The prompt adapts based on whether a tenant name was provided. Output is raw research text with citations where available.

### Stage 2 — Claude Report Synthesis (`synthesize_report`)

Model: `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, max 1500 tokens.

Claude acts as a **senior commercial real estate lending analyst** and transforms the raw Gemini research into a structured credit intelligence memo with five sections:

1. **Property Overview** — asset type, location context, use class
2. **Tenant Health** or **Vacancy & Marketability** — operational and financial signals, or vacancy/listing assessment
3. **Red Flags** — specific concerns for a commercial lender (liens, permit risk, vacancy duration, zoning)
4. **Positive Signals** — factors supporting creditworthiness or stability
5. **Analyst Summary** — 2–3 sentence bottom-line risk read with recommended due diligence items

The Claude prompt explicitly instructs a direct, analytical tone that acknowledges gaps in research rather than speculating.

---

### Stage 3 — Report Persistence (`save_analyst_report_md`)

Reports are saved to `/analysis/` as markdown files named:
```
YYYYMMDD_property-address-slug.md
```

The Streamlit UI also displays the raw Gemini research in a collapsible section as an audit trail.
